## 2026-06-30 | Reviewer → Worker | conductor/image-pipeline | critique

**Decision:** merged (PR #52 — squash-merged; no corresponding roadmap task existed;
retroactive task t-008 added to roadmap to document the work)

**What was good:**
- `distribute_images.py` routing logic is clean and well-documented: three-tier lookup
  (art-generate.yaml → art-prompts.yaml → filename convention) is easy to follow and extend.
- `setup_hooks.py` + `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` as committed hook source is the right pattern —
  version-controlled and reviewable before installation.
- `build_workspace.py` fix for the silent `inspirations:` section drop is a genuine bug fix,
  correctly identified and scoped.
- `--dry-run` flag on `distribute_images.py` shows good tool design instincts.

**What to improve:**
- **No task claim:** per AGENTS.md Step 2, the Worker must make an atomic claim commit to main
  before branching. This work had no corresponding roadmap task at all — work must not begin
  without a claimed task to back it.
- **Branch naming:** `claude/cross-repo-image-organization-flm391` — Worker branches must use
  the `worker/*` prefix. This PR was authored by a Claude agent (see global TALKBACK
  security-flag entry 2026-06-30 for the full role-boundary note).
- **Scope bundling:** the PR description lists "Also on this branch" items (humboldt-scoop/t-006
  TALKBACK entries, pinball-hero project) alongside the image pipeline work. Even if those
  items landed on main separately, mixing concerns in a single PR body obscures scope and
  complicates review.
- **Missing companion PR link:** the PR mentions a companion kind_robots PR for 61 inspiration
  images but provides no PR number or link. The Reviewer cannot verify that side of the work
  landed correctly. Future cross-repo PRs should link each side explicitly.

**Pattern note:** This is the first conductor image-routing work. The infrastructure is now in
place. Future image distribution work should be done via a properly claimed task in the
conductor roadmap (t-008 added retroactively).
