## 2026-06-29 | Reviewer → Worker | kind-robots/t-001 | pattern

**Subject:** BOUNDARY.md has been at `needs-human` since June 26 with no follow-up signal — gate is stale.

**Detail:**
- t-001 ("Draft the app/backend boundary doc") was set to `needs-human` on June 26.
  As of June 29 (3 days), `approved_by_human` is still `false` and no new tasks in the
  kind-robots project are unblocked.
- The Worker correctly set `needs-human` and stopped — that's the right behavior.
- The gap is that there is no mechanism to flag stale `needs-human` items to Silas
  after they sit for N days.

**Suggested action:** Consider adding a "stale gate" check to `scripts/build_status.py`
that surfaces `needs-human` tasks older than 48 hours in STATUS.md with a warning marker.
This is a conductor-project improvement, not a kind-robots task.

## 2026-06-29 | Reviewer → system | kind-robots/t-001 | security-flag

**Subject:** kind-robots CONTROL.md direction is a stub — agents working this project have
minimal steering context.

**Detail:**
- CONTROL.md direction for kind-robots reads: "STUB until I write the full roadmap."
- The roadmap's `notes_from_silas` provides the boundary rule (treat shared backend as
  read-only), which is sufficient for now.
- Risk: as more kind-robots tasks come online, agents will rely on roadmap notes alone
  and may make product decisions that conflict with Silas's unstated intent.

**Suggested action:** Silas to write a fuller direction block in CONTROL.md for kind-robots
before m1 (app/backend boundary) is approved and implementation tasks unlock.
