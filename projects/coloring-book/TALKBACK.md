# coloring-book — Project TALKBACK

## 2026-07-14 | Reviewer → Worker | coloring-book/t-019 | pattern

**Decision:** audited already-merged work (self-executed as Worker in a solo burst-mode session; kind_robots PR #260 merged)

**Failure category:** null (clean first pass on the scoped portion)

**What was good:**
- Read the actual kind_robots implementation before touching anything, which caught that the task description's "placeholder scaffold" framing was stale — the coloring engine (coloringStore.ts, coloring-canvas.vue, coloring-book-manager.vue) is functionally complete, not a placeholder.
- Kept the diff to exactly what was specified and verifiable: one tutorial-card entry, shaped identically to its five siblings.
- Didn't fabricate or skip the missing art assets — queued both via the established `projects/art-prompts.yaml` `requests:` mechanism instead of leaving them undocumented or inventing placeholder files.

**What to improve:**
- Could not run `eslint`/`vue-tsc` in kind_robots locally (`.nuxt/eslint.config.mjs` missing pre-`nuxt prepare`) — verification leaned on shape-parity review instead of tooling. Low risk given the change (single object-literal addition, no new imports/types), but a future session touching this file should run `nuxt prepare` first if time allows.

**Kaizen task:** t-020 — thicken coloring-book-page.vue's Generate/Proposals/Prompts tabs and add a second page set to coloring-book-manager.vue's SET_SLUGS, once t-006 lands.

**Pattern note:** Second instance this cycle (see conductor/t-012 pattern) of a roadmap task's note describing "scaffold"/"placeholder" state that had already moved past that description by the time it was picked up. Worth a standing reminder: read the target repo's current state before trusting a task's framing, especially on tasks that have sat `ready` for several days while related work merged elsewhere.

## 2026-07-17 | Reviewer → Worker | coloring-book/t-022 | pattern (autonomous conductor cycle)

**Decision:** merged conductor PR #697 (inventory reconciliation for Monster Recast book 1).
Recurring task flipped back to `status: ready` per convention; kaizen task t-029 filed.

**Failure category:** n/a (clean pass, recurring task in progress, not closed).

**What was good:**
- Reconciled all 18 represented_concept_ids without renaming or guessing files; the one
  ambiguous match (gothic-schoolgirl → mr-025) was explicitly flagged
  `needs_visual_verification: true` with a transparent "by elimination, not by text match"
  note rather than silently promoted to a confident match.
- Kept `accepted` fields untouched — respected the manifest's "confirmed approvals only from
  Silas" policy even though the task's own note allows "record accepted working files" later
  in the cycle.
- Verification was concrete and checkable: existence-checked every new inspiration path,
  reran both status scripts, confirmed the audit_roadmaps.py warning count was unchanged
  (pre-existing, unrelated).

**What to improve:**
- The elimination-only match is currently discoverable only by reading roadmap/proposals.yaml
  prose — nothing in `coloring_proposal_status.py --check` output flags it. Filed as t-029.

**Kaizen task:** t-029 — surface `needs_visual_verification`/elimination-only inspiration
matches directly in `coloring_proposal_status.py --check` output instead of leaving them to
prose notes.
