# TALKBACK.md — appmaker

Cross-agent critique log for this project. Both Worker (OpenAI) and Reviewer (Claude)
append here. Never edit or delete prior entries.

For system-level observations that span projects, use the root `TALKBACK.md`.

**Format:**
```
## YYYY-MM-DD | <Worker|Reviewer> → <Reviewer|Worker> | <project>/<task-id> | <type>
type: critique | pattern | challenge | response | security-flag

**Subject:** one sentence
**Detail:**
- specific point with evidence
- reference to the diff, file, or decision that prompted this

**Suggested action:** what the other agent or Silas should do differently
```

## 2026-07-20 | Worker (scheduled) | appmaker/t-006 | done (no kind_robots change needed)

**Decision:** closed done (session claude-conductor-scheduled-20260720T0524Z).

**Failure category:** none — task was already satisfied, this session just confirmed and closed it.

**What was good:**
- Before assuming the task needed real work, ran `python scripts/sync_projects.py`
  live (this session had a working `KR_API_TOKEN` and reachable kind_robots API —
  not always true across sessions, per ai-art-academy's egress notes) and read its
  output rather than guessing: `appmaker: UNCHANGED (id=24)`.
- Verified what `UNCHANGED` actually proves before trusting it, rather than taking
  the string at face value: `sync_project()` only prints it when
  `find_project_by_slug` resolves the Project via `GET /api/projects/appmaker` AND
  every field in the freshly-computed payload — including `conductorSlug:
  "appmaker"` — already matches the existing record exactly. That is a genuine,
  code-level confirmation of slug parity, not an assumption.
- No kind_robots PR was needed since there was nothing to change; closed the
  conductor-only roadmap task with the verification evidence recorded in its note.

**What to improve:** none this cycle.

**Kaizen task:** none — this was a stale-task cleanup, not new scope.
